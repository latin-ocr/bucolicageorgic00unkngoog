12 any one cause has operated more than every other to pro-
vent young nien from acquiring a free and easy manner of read—
ing the Latin poetS, it unquestionably is the habit of usin an
order qs construction, or an interpretation. The nse of eea
pernicious helps not only prevents those who rely on them from
ever acquiring the power of reading with ease and pleasure with-
out them, but it is utterly subversive of one of the principa] .
objecta of studying the language, that mental discipline which “
is acquired by the practice of critical and exact analysis. 'Phio
salutary influence, the use of an order or of an interpretation
effectually counteracts.

The student will hardly take the paine of disentangling an
intricate sentence when the work is done to his hand3 nor will
the test of grammatical constructionior of prosod be applied,
when a glauce at the interpretation will remove all nubta. Tha
habit os thus referring to the judgment of others soon becomes
settled3 while that of analysing is never formed, nor the disci·
pline of mind acquired, which it is suited to effect. Resides
thie, the babit os using these unnecessary aids prevents that feeling
of sels-reliance which successful efforts alone can secure.

,To this cause we must attribute the sact, that so few unaing
our educated rnen read the Latin poets with ease or pleasure.
But if the habit of readin‘r independently of foreign assistance bo
once formed, the want οῗ such assistance is not felt. lt in fauno
by experience that boys, who have been taught iu this way, read
Horace and Juvenal as readily as they do Cicero and Tacitu85
and even with mure confidence ; since in poetry they are furnish·
ed by prosody with an unerring test for resolvmg many doubts
while in prose they have no such aid.

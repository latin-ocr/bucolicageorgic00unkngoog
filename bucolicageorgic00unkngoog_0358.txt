never can forget.—Pererratis . . . . finibus .- 'each people, βιαιως their

' 63 . . . . 65. Ararim . . ·. . Tigrim .· the names of rivers flowing in dis·
tant regions could not, as has been observed, be familiar to an Italian
peasant: possibly, for this reason, his geogmffihy has been made ur·

osely incorrect. Parthia proper, bounded . by the Caspias), . by
flactriana, S. by the deserta of Caramania, W. by Media, was separated
by the latter country, and by part of Syria, from ‘the Tigris. On the
other hand, the Arar,'now the Saone, is a river of Gaul, and joins the ο
Rhene, near the present city of Lyons. Το this it has been replied‚
that the Parthians might, and did, in fact, make inroads and conquesta
as faras the Tigris3 and the Germane, as far as the Saone: though
these rivers were not within their territory, respectively, yet they
flowed in countries which each had conquered. ·

town, Apollonius Rhodius, and Varro, as cited by Servius, take episs
thets for the island ; no sufficient proof, indeed, ap ears ‚that any river
,thero ever bore this appellation. Servius thinks t e Oxus, a Bactrian
river, is meant3 and that creta significa the ‘chalk‚’ or ‘white clay,’
by which its stream was discoloured. Ad flumen Oxum perventum 'est .·

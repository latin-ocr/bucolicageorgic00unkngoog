The initiation consisted in part of a. kind of infernal drame, performed
with appi-o riute machinery and imagery, and was calculated tom-ke
«ι deep an awsul impressioni on the mind, and to prepare it for th·

even to reveal the secret doctrines there inculcuted. This hyipothesi·
os the learned prelato has given occasion to a mesterly tract rom the

en of the historianGibbon3 in which his reasons are assigned for dis-
gelievin that Virgil had any such design, He thinks thee 'sodo iu
borrowe and im roved from the Odyssey. See Gibbon's neella&

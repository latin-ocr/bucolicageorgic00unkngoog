which the ploughman grasps ιιι his lest hand. In Virgil’s plough, oss

As t e Italian plough-share appears to be more in a wedge fon-nuend,
therefore, in its movement to create reater friction than ours, it will
require to be more strongly set. T e duplex dorsum may, therefore,
mean a double back, or round, in which the share is fixed, not standing

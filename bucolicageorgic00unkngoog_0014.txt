These were among the first consideratione in publishing thia
edition os virgil. It was believed, also, that a more correct text,
than any in common use might be put into the hands of learneffl,
hy publishing in a popular form that which is the result of the
*combined labours of Heyne, Heinsius, Burmann, Wakefield, and
others. Such is the text now offered to the youthful student of
Virgil. Itis substantially Heyne’s, which is undoubtedly the most
perfect text extant, but with such slight variatione as a careful
collation of the abevementioned authorities seemed to recom-
mend. Itis printed from Didot’s stereotype edition. And it is
confidently believed, should any instructers examine the work,

. who have hitherto been confined to the use of the Delphin text,

that they will in this find many perplexities and stumblingblocks
mlfsspaepafing the Notes‚ free use has been made· of all the
materiale within the editor’s reach. In all cases where it could
consistently be done, the authority has been given, except where
the notes of Mr. Valpy’s edition have been adopted. These,

ἶ as his own remarks are frequently blended with other authorities

have not been particularly designated. The notes of the learned
1. H. Voss were first made English for that edition, to which
notes this is likewise indebdted. The notes are explanatory of
the text, and not designed to supersede the use of the Classical

ς Dictionary; which should never be out of the student’s reach.

In the vast variety of materials presented, it has been found dif-
ficult to be sufficiently concise. For it is easy to say much upon
, Virgil, hut difficult to say a little to the point. Bo s will not
, .voluntarily read long notes, even in the1r vernacu ar tongue;
much less in a foreign language. But, when embarrassed, they
will seek relies stom noteS, if they are short.

’ As no boy should be permitted to read virgil without being
able to scan every verse before he reads it, it was thought advis-

, '³⁷ able to subjoin a list of the most difficnlt verses with the method
'⁶ os scanning each3 as this will save the teaeher from frequent

interruptione while the student is ›reparing for recitation. The
Ι authority of Dr. Carey has been iJollowed in the Metrical Key.
A few questions have also been added, at the suggestion os some
of our most respectable instructerS, which may expedite the la-
bour of the teacher in ascertainin whether the pupil has con· -
suited his notes and his Classical ictionary, and lead to a more
cognected tgid definite view of the subject than the pupil would
ot erwise o tain.

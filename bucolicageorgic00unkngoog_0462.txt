AENEI'D. BOOK vl.

Tffls‘ is a book of great interest. Perhaps no other in the AEneid in
calculated to produce eo deep an im ression on the mind of the reader.
lt gives an account of the visit of neas to the Cumoean Sibyl, and of
his deecent with her ιο the infernal world. There, aster using
through the horrore of purgatory, he meet· his father Anc ‘ses in
Elysium3 who directa him aa to-hm future conduct, ivea him a proe-

ctive view of the glories of his posterity, and unfol s ιο him 'the sub-

ime doctrine of the unity and omnipresence of the Deity, of the im-
mortality of the ocul, and of a etate of rewards and punishments aster
death. He explains, likewise, the doctrine of the transmigration of
‘⁰2¹⁸’.m’ taught by Pythagoras, and inculcatas the importance of piety
an vutue. ·

1. Sic satur .· this refers to the exclamation contained in the last two
lines of the fisth book.—-Classique immittit habenas: ‘ and gives fun
auil to the fluet? This metaphor, taken from horses, here expresses
the unintermptedcourse of the fleet. It has already been· applied to
ιὲο ηρίἓθὶωὗνιρ of the vine, Geo. ii. 3643 and ιο the progress os stre,

n. v. ., .

2. Euboicis Cunmrum .- the* people of Cumoe in Italy claimed descent
from Chalcis, a town in Eubom, the most considerable island of Greece,
now called Negropont. , ’ ·

4. Fundabat: ‘held firmly; mooted? D.

g Tecta rapit, silvas .- σο. curma· ‘ hastily examine the woodo ς’ i. e.
rapido cursu perlustrant milvus. The horse is said campum rapere ,·
ud the nhil), equora rapere. H. This iu not the usual acceptation of
the pungo ; but it is in keeping 'with the remainder of the verse3 and
i· with much more ropriety said of the thick covert of wild beuta,
than that it me gagen-od for kindling a fire.

These were among the first consideratione in publishing this
edition of virgil. It was believed, also, that a more correct text
than any in common use might be put into the hands of kamere,
hy publishing in a popular form that which is the result of the
¹combined labours of Heyne, Heinsius, Burmann, Wakefield, and
others. Such is the text now offered to the youthful student of
virgil. Itis substantially Heyne’S, which is undoubtedly the most
perfect text extant, but with such slight variations as a careful
collation of the abovementioned authorities seemed to recom-
mend. Itis printed from Didot’s stereotype edition. And it is
confidently believed, should any instructers examine the work,

, who have hitherto been confined to the use of the Delphin text,

that they will in this find many perplexities and stumblingblocks

materialis within the editor's reach. In all cases where it could
consistently be done, the authority has been given, except where
the notes of Mr. Valpy’s edition have been adopted. These,

have not been particularly designated. The notes of the learned
1. H. Voss were first made English for that edition, to which
notes this is likewise indebted. The notes are explanatory of
the text, and not designed to Supersede the use of the Classical

will seek relief from noteS, if they are short.

As no boy should be permitted to read virgil without being
able to scan every verse before he reads it, it was thought advis-

interruptions while the student is reparing sor recitation. The

A few questions have also been added, at the suggestion of some
of our most respectable instructerS, which may expedite the la-

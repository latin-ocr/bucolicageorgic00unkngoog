m, Assnrnaeerit .- the author of the dialogue, De Orat. ascribed to
Tacitus, says, that in the theatro at Rome, the same complirnent was
paid to virgil himself: Testis ipsc populus, qui auditis iu theatro work·

Boeotia. Musoe dant tibi, Ο Galle, Itos calamos, en accipe eos, quos
dederunt ρηιὲ seni Ascraeo. .

72· Grynei.- Strabo, confirmed by Pausanias, fixes the situation of
Grynium in AEolis‚ and places there a temple and grove dedicated to
Apollo. Similar names seem to have been given to other places sacred
to the same divinity. The Celtic name' of the sun is Grian.

73. Jactec-Apollo .- Ειιρίιοιίοη,“α poet of Chalcis, had written a poem*
on the origin of oracles (Ecl. x. 50.)‚ including that of Grynium. Gal·
lus had imitated this poem 'in Latin verse. Serv. ,

74. Sc llam Nisi .· this is a dispute'd passage: Quid loquar, ut narra·
ver-‘it Scy ⁸ m Nisi filiam, quam sama secuta est succinctam quod ad can-

’ οἰκία inguina, &m virgil is thus made to ascribe to the daughter of

Nisus the transformation which Scylla,' the daughter of Phorcus,
tandei-went.x Other poets, it is true, have in the same manner blended

the two fables:

, Quid mirum in patrios, Scyllam, novt-oe capillos, ·
Candidaque in savos inguina versa canes. Propert- iv, 4.

But the storv os Scylla, the daughter of N isus, is elsewhere stated by
vir il, Geo. 1. 4043 it is ,therefore not robable that he would here
con ound her with another Scyllam un ess, as Cei-da supposes, both
were fabled to be transformed into sea-dogs. ,

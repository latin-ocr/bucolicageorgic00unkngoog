The initiation consisted in part ot* a kind of infernal drama, performed
with appro riate machinery and im ery, and was calculated tom-ke
a deep ang awful impression on e mind, and to prepare it for th·

admitted to the celebration of these m sterion, and that in the present
book, he means to give a figurative escription os ³his initiationsand
even to reveal the secret doctrines there inculcated. This h esi·
os the learned prelate has given occasion to a masterly tract rom the

en of the historiari Gibbon3 in which his reasons are assigned for dis-
gelievi that Virgil had any such design. He thinks the e 'sede iu
borrowe and im roved from the Odyssey. See Gibbon's recella-
neous Works. Vo. iv. ’

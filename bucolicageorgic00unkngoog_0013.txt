It· any one cause has operated more than every other to pre·
vent young nien from acquiring a free and easy manner os read-
ing the Latin poete, it unquestionably is the habit of usin an
order qs construction, or an interpretation. The nse os t eea
pernicioas helps not only prevents those who rely on them from
ever acquiring the power ofreading with ease and pleasure with-
out them, but it is utterly subversive of one of the principa! .
objecta of studying the language, that mental discipline which ‘
is acquired by the practice of critical and exact analysis. This
salutary influence‚ the use os un order or of an interpretation
effectually counteractS.

The student will hardly take the pains of disentangling an
intricate sentence when the work is done to his hand; nor wilt
the test of grammatical construction or os prosody be applied,
when a glance at the interpretation will remove all doubts. Tho
habit of thus referring to the judgment of others soon becomes
settled3 while that of analysing is never formed, nor the disci-
pline of mind acquired, which it is suited to effect. Resides
this, the habit os uslng these annecessary aids prevents that feeling
of self-reliance which successful efforts alone can secure.

,Το this cause we must attribute the fact, that so few among
our educated men read the Latin poets with ease or plenem-e.
But if the habit of readino independently of foreign assistance ho
once formed, the want οῗ such assistance is not selt. It is found
by experience that boys, who have'been taught in this way, read
Horace and Juvenal as readily as they do *Cicero and Tacitus-3
and even with more confidence ; since in poetry they are furnishf
ed by prosody with an unerring test for resolving many doubt&
while in prose they have no such aid.

These are not new views, Books furnished with these auxil·
iaries are going out of use in the best schools in sorei n coun-
trieS. Thirty years ago the learned and practica} icesimoe
Knox expressed his disapprobation of them.·¹‘'
